        <h1>About the Developers</h1>
        <h3>Mujahid Jaffer</h3>
      <div>  
        <p id="p01">
            Mujahid Jaffer is a sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Central Florida. His interest in CS started in his senior year of high school by taking an aptitude test that pointed him towards the field. He then took an introduction to programming course that was taught in Scratch. That drew his interest and he then pursued his degree. He has a 3.8 GPA and has been on the Dean's List since starting at UCF. He also works as a part-time warehouse manager, and volunteers at a couple of religious schools on Sunday Mornings to give back to the community. His hobbies aside from coding are playing sports such as basketball, soccer, and tennis in addition to spending time with his brothers!

            Once you're ready to get out of this sample project and edit your own code, you can use the dropdown
            in the left sidebar to switch folders. Right now, the dropdown says "Getting Started" - that's the
            folder containing the file you're looking at right now. Click on the dropdown and choose "Open Folderâ€¦"
            to open your own folder.
            You can also use the dropdown later to switch back to folders you've opened previously, including this
            sample project.

            THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT

        <h3>Quick Edit for CSS and JavaScript</h3>
        <p>
            No more switching between documents and losing your context. When editing HTML, use the
            <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl + E</kbd> shortcut to open a quick inline editor that displays all the related CSS.
            Make a tweak to your CSS, hit <kbd>ESC</kbd> and you're back to editing HTML, or just leave the
            CSS rules open and they'll become part of your HTML editor. If you hit <kbd>ESC</kbd> outside of
            a quick inline editor, they'll all collapse. Quick Edit will also find rules defined in LESS and
            SCSS files, including nested rules.
        </p>
